He is also\n        a CFA charterholder. He started his career on the equity trading floor\n        of Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. After his Masters in Finance at London\n        Business School, he joined the investment team of Orbis Investment\n        Advisory, and covered Japanese equity, working directly with billionaire\n        investor Allan Gray.

However, we are involved in empowering\n        people to manage their own money, as we want to contribute to other\n        people's financial independence. Our manager is giving annual sessions\n        at London Business School about investing. Should you be interested,\n        please contact us and we will be happy to discuss your specific needs.\n      </SubText>\n    </SectionAbout>\n  );\n};\nexport default AboutView;\n"],"names":["SectionAbout","styled","_templateObject","_taggedTemplateLiteral","Title","_templateObject2","SubTitle","_templateObject3","SubText","_templateObject4","_jsxs","id","children","_jsx"],"sourceRoot":""}
