        <h3>OUR MANAGER</h3>
        <div class="justify">
            He holds of Bachelor of Commerce from McGill University in Montreal, and he received a Master in Finance
            from London Business School. He is also a CFA charterholder. He started his career on the equity trading
            floor of Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. After his Masters in Finance at London Business School, he joined
            the investment team of Orbis Investment Advisory, and covered Japanese equity, working directly with

        <h3>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h3>
        <div class="justify">
            We have decided to manage our own capital, despite our relatively small size, because our experience with
            various banks and professional money managers has shown us that entities that accept third party funds
            are consistently more succesfull at collecting fees than at growing their clients' assets.
        </div>
        <div class="justify">
            We are looking for like minded family offices and private investors to exchange ideas and cooperate
            in private equity projects.
        </div>
        <div class="justify">
            We are not looking for funds to manage, as we believe that people should manage their capital themselves.
            However, we are involved in empowering people to manage their own money, as we want to contribute
            to other people's financial independence. Our manager is giving annual sessions at London Business School
            about investing. Should you be interested, please contact us and we will be happy to discuss your specific needs.
